I developed automated financial and utilization models for Medicaid claim validation and rate analysis. Using AWS Glue, Athena, SQL, and Python, I built ETL workflows to parse 837 EDI claim files, integrate them with plan master data, and calculate metrics like service utilization and reimbursement accuracy. The models supported claim rate validation, trend analysis, and cost adjustment, with dashboards in Power BI for tracking validated vs. rejected claims and identifying financial impact across providers.

Tools: AWS Glue, Athena, S3, SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel
Datasets: EDI 837 claims, Plan Master reference tables, curated claims (validated/rejected) datasets
